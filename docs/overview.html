<div id="course-objectives" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Course objectives</h1>
<p>The aim of this course is to review some of the developments in the
visualization and analysis of Earth-System Science (ESS) data using the
R language and data-analysis environment. ESS data sets are generally
large (in terms of both the number of attributes or variables and number
of data points), and are therefore frequently used as examples of “big
data”. They are often well organized, in the sense of being represented
as raster “slices” or “bricks” with dimensions like longitude, latitude
and time, but can also be instances of traditional “rectangular” data
sets, where the rows represent individual locations and the columns
variables or attributes.</p>
<p>Concurrently with the development of such large data sets, the tools
for analyzing them have proliferated. These tools include
special-purpose packages specifically designed for visualizing
particular data sets (like NCL (the NCAR Command Language)for analyzing
and mapping weather and climate data), individual programming languages
and environments like Matlab, Python and R, as well as traditional
programming languages like Fortran or C. Among these options, R easily
has the best developed set of data-analytical, visualization, and
statistical tools (with thousands of individual packages available), and
also has the necessary tools for reading and writing ESS data in their
various “native” forms. R also has extensive geospatial analysis “built
in”.</p>
<p>The goal of this course is to describe the nature of the ESS data and
data-set formats, the tools for reading and writing such data, and the
procedures for visualizing and analyzing the data. In addition, the
general ideas of “reproducible research” will be discussed and put to
use in developing individual projects that explore some particular data
sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="topics-covered" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Topics covered</h1>
<p>The specific topics that will be examined include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an introduction to Earth-System Science data in general</li>
<li>a general review of R and RStudio</li>
<li>Markdown, RMarkdown and reproducible research</li>
<li>ESS data sources</li>
<li>reading, writing and recasting ESS data</li>
<li>key R packages for reading and writing data (e.g. <code>ncdf4</code>
and <code>terra</code>)</li>
<li>mapping and geospatial techniques in R</li>
<li>basic visualization tools</li>
<li>strategies for dealing with high-dimension, high-resolution
data</li>
<li>prediction and multivariate analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>These topics implement and document a particular data-analysis
“design pattern” that involves</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>data input (using, for example, <code>ncdf4</code>,
<code>rhdf5</code>, <code>raster</code>, <code>terra</code>, or an ODBC
relational database package)</li>
<li>recasting the raster brick input data into a rectangular data
frame</li>
<li>analysis and visualization</li>
<li>recasting a “results” data frame back to a raster</li>
<li>data output, using the same packages as in step 1</li>

<p>Setting up an effective and efficient environment for data analysis
(i.e. a “tool chain”) can be as much of a time-waster as a time-saver.
We will describe and use a basic set of tools, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>R itself, and R packages from CRAN</li>
<li>RStudio, and related packages (e.g. <code>knitr</code>,
<code>rmarkdown</code>)</li>
<li>a GitHub account, and a Git client (e.g. Sourcetree)</li>
<li>a Markdown editor (e.g. MarkdownPad (Windows) or Macdown (Mac), many
others)</li>
<li>a text editor (e.g. Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code)</li>
<li>file-transfer approaches (SFTP (Filezilla) and Globus)</li>
<li>netCDF utilities and apps (netCDF, CDO, NCO, Panoply)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="project-and-tasks" class="section level1" number="4">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Project and Tasks</h1>
<p>Student effort in the course will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the completion of several tasks, such as installing R, taking it
for a spin, installing various other software packages, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The visualization/analysis of a typical or interesting ESS data
set using R, and the documentation of that analysis as an R Markdown
Notebook, HTML web page, Word document, or some other useful format
supported by RMarkdown.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Participating in a collaborative research environment, which
involves both</p>
<ul>
<li>asking questions and asking for help as issues arise, and</li>
<li>answering questions, as far as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Completion of the tasks should not be a major effort, and aren’t
really gradable (except for doneness). The project will require more
effort, ranging from a project that involves getting data, doing some
basic visualizations, and “publishing” the results (text and images) on
a simple web page, to something more elaborate, involving some advanced
statistical analyses, and a more involved publication such as the course
web page, or some other RMarkdown product.</p>
<p>It will be up to individual students how far or how deeply they want
to go. A general principle that’s worth following here is that a simpler
story told well is better than a complicated story told in a half-assed
fashion. Because the end product will be publicly available, it can
readily contribute to a portfolio, and experience shows that including a
URL to a nice-looking product on a resume or job application letter pays
off.</p>
<p>Collaboration would be fine, with the development of an agree-upon
“Author Responsibility” document ahead of time.</p>
<p>To summarize, the project will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifying an interesting Earth-system science-type data set, most
likely in the netCDF or HDF format</li>
<li>downloading of transferring the appropriate file(s)</li>
<li>reading the data into R</li>
<li>exploring the data using maps, plot, descriptive statistics</li>
<li>coming up with a “story” or outline that could involve
visualizations or data analyses</li>
<li>creating an RMarkdown-type document to tell that story</li>
<li>rendering the .Rmd document to .html (or an alternative)</li>
<li>copying the rendered document to the web</li>
<li>making a quick (3-5 minute) presentation in class</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level1" number="5">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Grading</h1>
<p>As will become apparent (and see the examples below), there are
various “levels” of Projects that can be attempted, ranging from a
simple Markdown “Notebook” hosted on <code>pages.uoregon.edu</code> to a
multi-page Markdown web site, with an accompanying GitHub code
repository and web site, and a complete and tidy project at any level
should be the goal to get “full marks” (e.g. an A- or B-level grade for
the course). However, there is a difference in the minimum effort
between the course levels:</p>
<p><strong>GEOG 490:</strong> Completion of the Tasks in a timely
fashion, and a Project consisting of an RMarkdown Notebook or web page
hosted on <code>pages.uoregon.edu</code>.</p>
<p><strong>GEOG 590:</strong> Completion of the Tasks in a timely
fashion, and a Project consisting of an Markdown web page or web site,
accompanied by a GitHub repository, hosted either on
<code>pages.uoregon.edu</code> or GitHub.</p>

<p>Publication packages like this, that combine a traditional paper with
code and data are now the norm in scientific publication, because they
allow a reader to reproduce the results presented in the paper. This
encourages collaboration, accelerates the pace of research, and
contributes to overall “quality assurance”.</p>
<p>Also, this web page, as well as that for GEOG 4/595 Geographic Data

<p>One thing that will become immediately apparent is that R produces
cryptic error messages. Because it’s hardly ever the case that you’ll be
typing new code into an empty document, many errors arise from simple
editing mistakes or typos. Simply Googling the error message will
quickly resolve an issue, and often will take you to one of the
following links:</p>
<ul>

<p>ChatGPT is another option for getting some ideas on error messages,
and for getting simple code fragments, but it can easily get off track
(Garbage In -&gt; Garbage Out).</p>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong> See above.</p>
<p><strong>Incompletes:</strong> There is a new, less flexible policy
for Incompletes: <a
href="https://provost.uoregon.edu/grades-incompletes-policy">[https://provost.uoregon.edu/grades-incompletes-policy]</a>.
Do not use the possibility of an “automatic” incomplete as a
time-management tool at the end of the term.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance (Student:</strong> You really should attend class.
The last half hour of class each day (3:20 - 3:50pm) will be devoted to
debugging and other non-lecture-type activities.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance (Instructor):</strong> UO has announced a pilot
“Floating Holiday” for <em>employees</em> (not students, Ah-ha-ha–sorry)
<a
href="https://hr.uoregon.edu/floating-holiday-pilot-2023-24">[https://hr.uoregon.edu/floating-holiday-pilot-2023-24]</a>.
I would generally claim the day of Perihelion for its climatic and
Earth-system science significance, but Perihelion occurred before
classes started this year (Jan 2nd). Maybe Imbolc or St. Brigid’s
day–I’ll let you know).</p>
<p><strong>Communicating with instructors:</strong> Pat Bartlein, <a
href="mailto:bartlein@uoregon.edu"
class="email">bartlein@uoregon.edu</a>, OH at 2-3pm Wednesdays (via
Zoom), or by email. GE or by email.</p>
<ul>
<li>If interest warrants, we will have an ongoing discussion area on
Canvas on course mechanics and topics. You can post questions there. If
you have a question, others probably do too, and it would be a service
to everyone to ask.<br />
</li>
<li>We will also communicate course information through Canvas
announcements and emails. Announcements and emails are archived there
and automatically forwarded to your UO email, and can even reach you by
text. Check and adjust your Canvas settings under Account &gt;
Notifications.</li>
<li>We understand you may have irregular or constrained schedules, and
we are available to talk outside the scheduled office hours. Email or
call. Voicemail messages will be sent to us as an email. We may not be
available all the time, and sowe may need to set an appointment to
talk.</li>
<li><em>Response time</em>: The instructor and GE will check emails
intermittently during weekdays. Usually you will be able to get an
answer from us on weekdays within six hours. In evenings and on
weekends, response time will be much slower. We want to answer your
questions and help you succeed in this course. Help us do that by
starting on assignments early so you can identify questions early enough
to get a response from us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Requirements:</strong> You will need access to the
internet, to UO’s Canvas site, and to a browser at a minimum, and
ideally a personal computer you have administrative rights on. If you
have questions about accessing and using Canvas, visit the <a
href="https://service.uoregon.edu/TDClient/2030/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=86662">Canvas
Support for Students</a> page. Canvas and Technology Support also is
available by phone or live chat, Monday-Sunday 6 a.m. to 12 a.m.
541-346-4357 <a href="livehelp.uoregon.edu">livehelp.uoregon.edu</a>. If
you face Internet access challenges, computer labs are open for students
on campus. To learn more about options visit Information Services’ <a
href="https://service.uoregon.edu/TDClient/2030/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=101263">Internet
Access Resources</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other topics, including classroom behavior:</strong>
Computers are welcome, for note taking, viewing course-related material,
and trying out code. Using a computer, tablet, or phone during class for
anything else would be unprofessional.</p>
<p><strong>Standard University Policies and Sources for
Help:</strong></p>
<p>The support provided by the following may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>UO Division of student life: <a
href="http://studentaffairs.uoregon.edu/">http://studentaffairs.uoregon.edu/</a></p></li>
<li><p>University Counseling and Testing Center: <a
href="http://counseling.uoregon.edu">http://counseling.uoregon.edu</a><br />

<li><p><em>Accessible Education:</em> Please let us know within the
first two weeks of the term if you need assistance to fully participate
in the course. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based
information, in-class activities, and exams. The Accessible Education
Center <a href="http://aec.uoregon.edu/">http://aec.uoregon.edu/</a>
works with students to provide an instructor notification letter that
outlines accommodations and adjustments to class design that will enable
better access. Contact the Accessible Education Center for assistance
with access or disability-related questions or concerns.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p><em>Conduct:</em> The University Student Conduct Code (available
at <a href="conduct.uoregon.edu">conduct.uoregon.edu</a> defines
academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or
attempting to commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. By
way of example, students should not give or receive (or attempt to give
or receive) unauthorized help on assignments or examinations without
express permission from the instructor. <em>However, you do have
permission to discuss and collaborate on the exercise tasks, providing
answers are constructed independently.</em> Students should properly
acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g. quotations,
paraphrases, ideas) and use only the sources and resources authorized by
the instructor. If there is any question about whether an act
constitutes academic misconduct, it is the students’ obligation to
clarify the question with the instructor before committing or attempting
to commit the act. Additional information about a common form of
academic misconduct, plagiarism, is available at:<br />
<a
href="https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism">https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism</a><br />
</p></li>
<li><p><em>Inclement Weather:</em> (Let’s hope for a little…) It is
generally expected that class will meet unless the University is
officially closed for inclement weather. If it becomes necessary to
cancel class while the University remains open, this will be announced
on Canvas and by email. Updates on inclement weather and closure are
also communicated in other ways described here: <a
href="https://hr.uoregon.edu/about-hr/campus-notifications/inclement-weather/inclement-weather-immediate-updates">https://hr.uoregon.edu/about-hr/campus-notifications/inclement-weather/inclement-weather-immediate-updates</a><br />
</p></li>
<li><p><em>We are designated reporters:</em> For information about my
reporting obligations as an employee, please see Employee Reporting
Obligations on the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance
(OICRC) website. Students experiencing sex or gender-based
discrimination, harassment or violence should call the 24-7 hotline
541-346-SAFE [7244] or visit <a
href="safe.uoregon.edu">safe.uoregon.edu</a> for help. Students
experiencing all forms of prohibited discrimination or harassment may
contact the Dean of Students Office at 5411-346-3216 or the
non-confidential Title IX Coordinator/OICRC at 541-346-3123. Additional
resources are available at investigations.uoregon.edu/how-get-support.
We are also mandatory reporters of child abuse. Please find more
information at Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mental Health and Wellness:</em> Life at college can be very
complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience
anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help
navigating challenges in their life. If you’re facing such challenges,
you don’t need to handle them on your own–there’s help and support on
campus. As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support,
I will express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to
resources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the
details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I
care and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to
do—for yourself and those you care about. University Health Services
help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you
need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with
another student who has been in the same place as you, visit the Duck
Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of
the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find out more at <a
href="health.uoregon.edu/ducknest">health.uoregon.edu/ducknest</a>.
University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff
members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide
identity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential.
Find out more at counseling.uoregon.edu or by calling 541-346-3227
(anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is
available by calling this same number).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Basic Needs:</em> Any student who has difficulty affording
groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a
safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their
performance in the course is urged to contact the Dean of Students
Office (346-3216, 164 Oregon Hall) for support. This UO webpage includes
resources for food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation,
technology, finances, and legal support: <a
href="https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds/food/">https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds/food/</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Accommodation for Religious Observances:</em> The university
makes reasonable accommodations, upon request, for students who are
unable to attend a class for religious obligations or observance
reasons, in accordance with the university discrimination policy which
says “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is unable to attend
classes on a particular day shall be excused from attendance
requirements and from any examination or other assignment on that day.
The student shall make up the examination or other assignment missed
because of the absence.”” To request accommodations for this course for
religious observance, visit the Office of the Registrar’s website and
complete and submit to the instructor the “Student Religious
Accommodation Request” form prior to the end of the second week of the
term (<a
href="https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances">https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances</a>)</p></li>
